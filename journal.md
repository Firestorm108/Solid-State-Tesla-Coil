Final project speedrun! I first researched common SSTC circuits on youtube and various forums and ended up with a pretty simple one running off 120VAC mains. I then picked out parts from various sources. 
Finally, I turned it into a PCB in order to clean things up a good amount.

Even though these thick traces aren't super necessary, copper is free so it's better to account for it than not.

Time Spent: 4 Hours
